WATER is flat (low nDSM), it accumulates into depressions (high TWI or low TPI), it has a low temperature (thermal infrared – TIRS) and it has high near-infrared absorption (negative NDVI)
TREES have varying heights (high nDSM standard deviation) and have high near-infrared reflectance (high NDVI).
BUILDINGS are often rectangle (high rectangular fit), are tall (high nDSM), and have high slopes.
GRASS is short (low nDSM), it’s flat (low nDSM standard deviation), and has moderate near-infrared reflectance (moderate NDVI).
ROADS reflect a lot of light (high RGB), they are flat (low nDSM), have a high light intensity, and it has a low or negative NDVI.
